Everyone likes to think their music taste is unique. Ever wonder how unique it is in comparison to someone else's? 


## Background
I have a friend who believes his taste in music is both immaculate and rare. He once asked me if it would be possible to build something that allows him to prove this theory, and I decided to oblige. My first attempt at this can be found in my (personal music tracker project)[], which makes use of the Spotify API and tracks the average popularity of all songs in my library on a daily basis. 

With this project, I will be creating an application that allows individuals to check these metrics for themselves at any time. It will include support for Spotify and Tidal, as they both provide free API access to developers.
